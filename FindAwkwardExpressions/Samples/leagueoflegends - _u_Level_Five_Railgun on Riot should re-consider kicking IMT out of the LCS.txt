/u/Level_Five_Railgun on Riot should re-consider kicking IMT out of the LCS
Learn to fucking read. Do you even fucking understand the situation? League's biggest and direct competitor from an industry standpoint isn't Overwatch, it's Dota. Gameplay and mechanics are practically the same. Near identical structure, near identitical storylines.  It has NOTHING to do with the actual game itself. I doubt Riot even gives a shit about OW, a game that peaks at 20k viewers. Its about IMT building their OWL studio IN LOS ANGELES and aims to PROMOTE IT. That makes them a direct competitor to the LCS. Not to League, but to LCS. The actual show since both IMT and Riot would be doing the same thing of a live esports show. It's not illegal? You're literally bitching about IMT diversifying their team profile and defending Rito for supposedly being insecure jealous little brats.  Once again. Can you fucking read? So something has to be illegal for Riot to not accept it? Last time I checked, Riot is the one deciding who goes into THEIR league, not the police. Why the hell would Riot want to pay LCS money to the org who is literally building a studio to compete against them? You're basically demanding that Play Station only carry EA games because every other game is a direct competitor to EA? Or how XBox should only carry Nintendo games for the same reason? That's literally the dumbest reason.  No. That is literally not anything like what I said. You just have shit reading comprehension. Your comparisons also makes zero sense. Then your next argument is that Rito is paying them? Dude, Rito is paying them SCRAPS which is why teams need to diversify.  Holy shit... THE LCS IS GETTING REVENUE SHARING NEXT SPLIT. Teams like TSM, C9, CLG, etc also have teams outside of League yet they weren't singled out by Rito.  BECAUSE NONE OF THEM ARE FUCKING BUILDING A GOD DAMN ESPORTS STUDIO IN THE SAME AREA THAT THE LCS ALSO OPERATES IN. Is that clear enough for you? Like seriously? How many god damn times do I have to keep explaining this? IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH OVERWATCH OR THE OVERWATCH LEAGUE. It is about the fact that IMT is committed to building and promoting their OWL arena in the same area as Riot. IMT wants to be the top esports attraction in LA, which happens to be where Riot is currently operating in. If IMT's OW team was based in other cities like C9 or OG, Riot wouldn't give a shit. Once again. It has NOTHING to do with the actual games. It is based on the fact that IMT is going to LOCALLY COMPETE against the LCS. Is that clear enough? Do I need to repeat 10 more times before you understand it?
