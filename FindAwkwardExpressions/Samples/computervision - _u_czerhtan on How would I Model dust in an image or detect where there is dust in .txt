/u/czerhtan on How would I Model dust in an image or detect where there is dust in the image using openCV?
Well if your surface is flat, you need to fit it back to a 2d plane using a homography transformation, and then evaluate the difference between the original (reference) image, and the captured one. You would have to account for lighting in the comparison, so having a (dust-free) reference marker on the surface for color correction (and white balancing) would make it much easier to solve. Lighting detection methods are often used in augmented reality apps so that virtual objects added to the scene can be nicely shaded. In your case, the same information can be used to remove the shading from the captured image, and then reveal the other alterations (which should be the dust). Hopefully, you don't have to deal with surfaces that are highly reflectivem or that scatter light in strange ways...
