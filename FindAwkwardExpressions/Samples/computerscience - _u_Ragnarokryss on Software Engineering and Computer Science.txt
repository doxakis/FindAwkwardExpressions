/u/Ragnarokryss on Software Engineering and Computer Science
Heh, I'm not sure but... I'd say Software Engineering is about designing usually complex, large software. A software engineer may very well write not code at all, but only make plans for the software. He would be the starting point of a program, and programmers will use his work to know what to do. It is the software engineer who will have understanding of the whole program, and know how it's different parts interact with each other. Computer science is... a lot about programming... and I guess also about networks, security, databases, etc.
