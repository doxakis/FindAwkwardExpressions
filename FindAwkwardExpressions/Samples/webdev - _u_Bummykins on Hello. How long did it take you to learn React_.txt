/u/Bummykins on Hello. How long did it take you to learn React?
Are you ready for it? It Dependsâ„¢ I think the Vue version came together a little quicker, but it felt a little looser, less encapsulated and testable. I think with more time that feeling would probably turn out to not be true. It really is progressive in that you can go from as simple as a script tag in the body, to single component files, and everywhere in between. Thats good and bad. For slowly converting an old jQuery app, piece by piece, I would probably use Vue, it plays really nicely with existing libs when needed, better than React seemed to. For writing a new medium+ sized app, I would probably use React. Bigger ecosystem and tooling, more established patterns. Possibly better testing, didn't get into that with Vue.
