/u/AnotherCrazyOne on Microsoft Introduces Surface Book 2
I see sports casters have promotional units in front of them, but they never use them. Further, I have seen many not even have anything in front of them at all, often on the field stages. They look like nothing more than fake advertising plants and turn me off to the devices. Conversely I see local newscasters using iOS devices to Periscope during broadcasts. The actual use factor makes it interesting.
