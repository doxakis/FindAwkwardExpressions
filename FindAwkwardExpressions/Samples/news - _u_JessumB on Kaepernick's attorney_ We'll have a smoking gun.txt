/u/JessumB on Kaepernick's attorney: We'll have a smoking gun
Because the CBA specifies the exact type of damages that would be owed if in fact there is collusion. Kaepernick would stand to earn millions. Also, any sort of proven collusion would allow the NFLPA to cancel the current CBA altogether and force negotiations on a new labor contract. Not something the owners would be at all in favor of considering how ridiculously one-sided the current CBA is.
