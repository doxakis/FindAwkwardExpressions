/u/Enlogen on Do you have to close stream for every data you send via POST method in C#?
From https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream(v=vs.110).aspx : "Do not override the Close method, instead, put all the Stream cleanup logic in the Dispose method." Streams implement IDisposable, so you should use the using() statement to ensure they're closed and removed from memory when they fall out of scope  // Get the request stream. using(Stream dataStream = request.GetRequestStream()) { // Write the data to the request stream. dataStream.Write(byteArray, 0, byteArray.Length); } // Stream object's .dispose() method is called automatically after the block in the using statement. // The Stream is closed as part of it's .dispose() method.
