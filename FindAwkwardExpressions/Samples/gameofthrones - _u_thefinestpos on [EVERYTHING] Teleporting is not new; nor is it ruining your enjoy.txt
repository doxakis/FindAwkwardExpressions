/u/thefinestpos on [EVERYTHING] Teleporting is not new; nor is it ruining your enjoyment of the show. LEARN CINEMATOGRAPHY BECAUSE THE TIMELINES ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE IF YOU DO.
If people need to be taught theories on cinematography and be explained in steps what happened, then the show obviously didn't do a good job of it (especially considering these issues were not present earlier in the series). My guess is that people won't react well to anything I post on here. I think a lot of people are bashing on the series because they don't like the direction its going or have anxiety concerning if TWOW will ever come out; they feel in some sense that the promise George made to them at the start of the series is being violated. And so one of the ways they channel that is by picking at contrivances (which all stories have) and misconstruing them as plot holes (which most stories also have).  That is one crazy, overthinking logic here. Some people aren't enjoying the series as much but they might as well watch it since it's still great TV and the books aren't going to finish anytime soon.
