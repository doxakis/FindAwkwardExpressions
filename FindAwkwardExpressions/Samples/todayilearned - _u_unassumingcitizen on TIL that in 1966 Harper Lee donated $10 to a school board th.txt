/u/unassumingcitizen on TIL that in 1966 Harper Lee donated $10 to a school board that tried to ban To Kill a Mockingbird with a note that said "I hope [the $10] will be used to enroll the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice."
Speaking as a conservative, I would like to remind you that our political views don't mean we are ignorant, uneducated, or hateful. It is definitely un-American to burn books. My views on government and society do not affect my understanding of free speech. Idiots and geniuses are equally free to say what they like. No one should be physically attacked for their words, and it would be wise of everyone to read things they don't agree with. Who knows, someone might actually learn something.
