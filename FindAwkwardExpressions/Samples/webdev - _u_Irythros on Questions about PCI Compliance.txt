/u/Irythros on Questions about PCI Compliance
but I'm not sure where you are getting that VPS and cloud hosting are in anyway an issue with SAQ A, do you have any more information on this?  The requirements given to us for SAQ A required us to secure the routers to the server. With a shared/vps/cloud setup we do not have access at all to them. We were failed for that. Additionally if you look at SAQ A 9.7 you cannot abide by that if you're not in full control of the HD and server. I'm also confused about where you say that asking for CVV breaches PCI compliance. Of course it can't be stored, but if you never ask for it then it could never be validated...?  Also, when we ticked that we asked for CVV it just straight up failed us. It's also in the PCI quick guide: Cardholder data refers to any information printed, processed, transmitted or stored in any form on a payment card. Organizations accepting payment cards are expected to protect cardholder data and to prevent their unauthorized use â€“ whether the data is printed or stored locally, or transmitted over a public network to a remote server or service provider.  but if you never ask for it then it could never be validated...?  You use a 3rd party (such as stripe) where they have the security and agreements. I've worked with 4 different merchant account providers 3 different PCI Compliance companies and not a single one ever allowed access to the CVV without immediate failure. SAQ C isn't even for e-commerce channels, it's for POS that are connected to the internet.  I just checked and right now that is actually correct, however older SAQ C versions it was for ecommerce. However I did last do PCI compliance about 6 months ago and the company sent us SAQ C after checking that we were ecommerce. I've also never had SAQ B or A required unless we were processing the card ourself. Everything I mention is from dealing with merchant account providers/PCI compliance companies.
