/u/CancerFaceEww on What's a bad thing everyone should experience atleast once in their life?
Dying, or at least directly facing your mortality. Cancer almost took me, it was really close at one point. My best friend was leaving my house and hugged me really hard, hard enough that it hurt a little in my weakened state. I waved out the window as he left and I saw him crying in the car. He didn't expect to see me again. I made it. It's five years later now and we've never spoken about this between us. I don't want to ever bring it up but damn it still makes me feel good that I mean that much to someone else outside of family. Bonds of friendship give real strength and he stood there with my family. Hell, he is family now. He's my brother.
