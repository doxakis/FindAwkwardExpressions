Your submission was automatically flagged because your account is very new (fewer than 7 days old). We try to avoid the "person makes account just to ask question/post something, then doesn't contribute" model, so please wait a few days before posting. In the meantime, please contribute in comments or with submissions elsewhere on reddit! I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.
