/u/Oceanswave on C# using Macbook
Intel has been slacking a bit when it comes to releasing CPUs — intel just released a laptop cpu that can support more than 16GB (core i7 8th gen) in August, which was obviously too late for the Apple laptop refresh earlier this year - so we might see MBPs with up to 32gb of DDR4 early next year. In my experience, you can just barely squeak by — even with VS 2017 and SharePoint VMs (with crawls turned off) with 4GB to host and 12 to the VM — but be prepared to kill some processes when your SP site becomes unresponsive because SQL has run out of ram and is churning through the page file. But man, a 32GB MBP would be some sweetness ...
