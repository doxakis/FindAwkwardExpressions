/u/ominousgraycat on Iranian leader urges Europe to defy 'mentally retarded' Donald Trump over nuclear pact
I agree with you... Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say he's a great guy, but compared with the Ayatollah, probably not so bad. However, the Ayatollah's point still kind of stands. Ayatollah might not be the greatest on human rights, but he knows exactly what he is doing. Trump doesn't know what he is doing much of the time. Trump is unintelligent and it is in everyone's best interest for the nuclear pact to stay in effect.
