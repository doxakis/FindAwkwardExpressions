/u/__The_wanderer__ on There's a petition for ESRB to declare loot boxes as gambling.
How is buying a loot crate gambling? Can u get nothing from it? Can u lose money from it? Or are you told exactly what you can get from it? Just because u are unhappy with what u get or can get, doesn't make it gambling. If u think that spending money on something that describes what u may get is gambling, then u don't understand what gambling is. If loot crates cost real money and there's a chance u can get absolutely nothing from them, then that's gambling.
