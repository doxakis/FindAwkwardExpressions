/u/gRod805 on TIL that not only is USA the 3rd most populated country in the world, but if it had ONE BILLION MORE people, it would still be the 3rd most populated country in the world.
Most people who say this don't really understand the intricacies of the US immigration system. Why should the kid who's biological mom is a Chinese national and paid an American surrogate to have the kid be born in the US be much better than a dreamer. One is a US citizen the other is not. The citizen might not even spend much time in the US yet he's better in people's eyes?
