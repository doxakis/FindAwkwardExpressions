/u/mrcooldaddy on Can Cloud 9 Carry NA to semi-finals?
um if very much matters who they were playing against if you want to say the C9 game was dominate. They had an easier opponent to try it against so you can't flat out ignore that. AN is ass so sneaky should already have beaten him either way westdoor is a free lane win. So i wouldnt take anything special away from it.btw WEs comp was pretty risky if TSM had played it right since svens just tried to answer everything condi did instead of pressuring somewhere else so if WE was the one that brought it up i have no doubt in my mind Condi would punish Contractz
