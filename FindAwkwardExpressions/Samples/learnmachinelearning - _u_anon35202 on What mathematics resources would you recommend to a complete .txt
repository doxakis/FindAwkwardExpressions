/u/anon35202 on What mathematics resources would you recommend to a complete ML Noob
What I want to know is why newbies aren't asking this of Doctors, Lawyers, Surgeons, Dentists, and many other professions where a 4 year bachelors degree is a "good start"? Why not ask about getting some good books for novices on piloting large aircraft? It's why the programming profession gets no respect, people have no clue how hard this is, and think the whole thing can be mastered in a few caffeinated weekends. If you want what you say you want, you'll spend 4 years getting your bachelors in computer science, then 2-3 years getting your masters degree in Machine Learning. You inadvertently insult us by implying this profession is something a newbie can jump into in a few months. I recommend you take a hard look at the process you are using to reach your goals, and decide what it is you want in life, and take those steps which will take you there. Newbies puttering around with ML algorithms is great, but that's all you'll be doing, like an novice who wants to work on jet engines, so he farts around with sheet metal and jet fuel.
