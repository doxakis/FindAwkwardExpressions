/u/quicksilver03 on How could one go about testing/comparing cloud services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud?
I've done a similar reasoning when writing The Cloud Hosting Handbook : either you have a precise use case and the comparison is "just" implementing it with the various cloud providers, or you don't have one and there's no better way than running some common benchmarks to derive figures. It goes without saying that having an actual use case is 100's times better than synthesizing something with a couple of benchmarks. Also, keep in mind that some applications do not really need the elasticity which is the strongest point of the various cloud providers: if you're in this situation, consider other forms of hosting such as renting VPS or dedicated servers, or even colocation if you can spend the money upfront.
