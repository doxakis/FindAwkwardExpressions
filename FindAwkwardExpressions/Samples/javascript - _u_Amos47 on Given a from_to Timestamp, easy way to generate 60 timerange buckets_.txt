/u/Amos47 on Given a from/to Timestamp, easy way to generate 60 timerange buckets?
Have you considered just using seconds to split up your bucket?  range = maxDate.getTime() - minDate.getTime(); bucketSize = range / NUM_BUCKETS; // in seconds  Then to get the bucket sizes you need to allocate them in some way. I would probably create some buckets in the following way.  buckets = []; for(let epochTime = minDate.getTime(); epochTime < maxDate.getTime(); epochTime += bucketSize){ buckets.push({min: epochTime, times: []}); }  Then to put a new date into the buckets object  function addDateToBucket(buckets, date){ let prevBucket = buckets[0]; for(let i = 1; i < buckets.length; i++){ let bucket = buckets[i]; if(bucket.min > date.getTime()){ prevBucket.times.push(date); return; } } prevBucket.times.push(date); // last bucket will be missed by loop }  A library seems like overkill, but I'm sure the monster that is momentjs will have something to help.
