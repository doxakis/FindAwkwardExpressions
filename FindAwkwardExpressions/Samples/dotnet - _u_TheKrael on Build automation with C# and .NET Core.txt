/u/TheKrael on Build automation with C# and .NET Core
My current nuke build script does Clean output directories Determine and inject version using GitVersion Compile all projects Call Authenticode signtool Package some nugets (more complex than what dotnet pack does) Run Tests, Wrap the Call in OpenCover and call ReportGenerator for a nice coverage html report Call docfx metadata and docfx to build API documentation Update TFS Build Number, expose build artifacts for the build server to pick up  The first three could be handled by dotnet build, the docfx call could possibly be covered by this, too. As for OpenCover, I really want to keep this outside of msbuild/VisualStudio. Builds in VS should be lean and small. So in any case I'll end up with some sort of orchestration system which wraps the calls to dotnet build dotnet xunit docfx metadata and all the other things. Nuke does exactly that. And it does it better than some naive batch or powershell script with less code. The Entire Build Script I just mentioned is 200 lines of code.
