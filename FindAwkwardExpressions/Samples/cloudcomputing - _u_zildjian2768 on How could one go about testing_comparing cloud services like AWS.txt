/u/zildjian2768 on How could one go about testing/comparing cloud services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud?
Each one of these services has their own ins and outs of course, but if you want to have a consistent way to interact with each of them and compare similar services, I would personally suggest trying to use Terraform to deploy infrastructure on each one in a consistent fashion. I am a Terraform apologist whereas others are very much not a fan. It has a decent learning curve. The only issue for you would be determining if issues are Terraform related or cloud provider related. You could then potentially deploy similar apps on each service and compare at that point. That's a big project but would be a great learning experience.
