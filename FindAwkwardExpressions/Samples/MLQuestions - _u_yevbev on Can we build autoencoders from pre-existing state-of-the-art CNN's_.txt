/u/yevbev on Can we build autoencoders from pre-existing state-of-the-art CNN's?
As far as I understand, the main benefit of the Autoencoder is to learn and map to a latent(ie. compressed) representation of the data. Therefore, the downsampling done in the encoder shouldn't be a problem regardless of the skip connections(don't these downsample anyway?). But I see your concern in the upsampling phase! You are basically feeding your input back, and the point is: if I am feeding my input to a later layer, why would the AE learn anything meaningful for the prior layers if it can just "Cheat" and use the skips. This is a good observation(would be an interesting paper). However, I don't think you need an Autoencoder, I think the convolutional layers should give you plenty of data.
