/u/Chocolate_Pickle on [D] Classifying Data With No Discernible Differences
I have my doubts too. I don't see this as a categorisation problem. It's more of a regression as skill is continuous. Once a gameplay meta is established and documented, most players follow similar behaviours amongst all leagues (we all watch Twitch streams). So you can't look at your stats for behavioural features. Leagues obfuscate your skill features because it pairs similarly skills players, and the whole things resolves down to a Nash Equilibrium. Observing players against a known constant, say bots, would remove the Nash aspect and allow you to get your answer.
