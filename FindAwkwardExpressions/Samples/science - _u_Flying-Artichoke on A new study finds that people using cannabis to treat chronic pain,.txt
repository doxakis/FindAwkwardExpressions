/u/Flying-Artichoke on A new study finds that people using cannabis to treat chronic pain, seizures, and inflammation, resulting from rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, spinal cord injury/disease, cancer and other conditions, reduced or completely stopped using opioids.
One of my best friends has Crohn's. Aside from his transfusions or whatever, you can tell weed helps him a ton with just day to day stuff and appitite (Also didnt help he was on ADHD meds). He said it also seemed to help lengthen the time needed between transfusions. Weed affects everybody differently but it should be something to look into. Also, a good budtender goes a long way to find which strains work best for your needs, that and you don't actually have to get high if you don't want to so some of the increased appitite and Anxitey stuff comes less into play. Just get straight CBD stuff
