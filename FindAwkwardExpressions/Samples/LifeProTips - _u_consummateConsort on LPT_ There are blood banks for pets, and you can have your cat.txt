/u/consummateConsort on LPT: There are blood banks for pets, and you can have your cat or dog donate blood to help other pets
Where do you live that someone can legally give consent for your blood to be drawn as a parent or guardian but said parent or guardian also doesnt speak your language and neither does any of the hospital staff? Edit: not that I'm agreeing with the root comment, the reply just struck me as odd.
