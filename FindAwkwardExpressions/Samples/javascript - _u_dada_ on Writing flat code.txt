/u/dada_ on Writing flat code
Maybe this is different in javascript, but when I would build games in Actionscript it was always better for performance to always use a for loop as oppose to stuff like "forEach" or other array methods.  Well, first of all it's worth noting that you should not rely on your knowledge of Actionscript optimizations (whether AS1/2 or AS3) anymore. I suspect you know this, but it's worth mentioning. Javascript may even have a different optimization profile in some cases depending on which engine you are using (e.g. Chrome's V8 engine, Firefox's SpiderMonkey, or Edge's Chakra). They are also more optimized than Adobe's AVM2. But more importantly, you need to have an argument for optimizing something in the first place. In the overwhelming majority of cases, you will not need to optimize Javascript. Unless you are indeed programming a game, or something that renders every frame, or if you are optimizing some DOM heavy aspect of a large SPA. I virtually never do micro optimization. It's something you seldom need to pay attention to, in part because by far most code you write in Javascript only executes sporadically (e.g. a handler for a button, or some code that runs in response to data being loaded). For most use cases, it's very rare that there is serious cpu time to gain.
