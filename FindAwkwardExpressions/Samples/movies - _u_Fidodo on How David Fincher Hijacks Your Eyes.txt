/u/Fidodo on How David Fincher Hijacks Your Eyes
I don't know if impersonal is the right word. I think it's something similar, but not quite that. It's uncomfortable because it feels like you're invading the character's personal space, like you're claustrophobically too close to them. To me it's not that it's impersonal, it's that it's too personal, and my instinct is to try and get away. It's a cool effect regardless.
