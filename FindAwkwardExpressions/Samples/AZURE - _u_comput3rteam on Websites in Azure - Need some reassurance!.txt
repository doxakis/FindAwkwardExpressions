/u/comput3rteam on Websites in Azure - Need some reassurance!
Cost effectiveness comes from being able to shut down VMs when not needed, or change the VM size based on demand (within a given class of VM), or having a clustered/load-balanced application that needs to be auto-scaled up for limited amounts of time then scaled down (you're running a baseball site and the world series happens, and the high times for that is right around game time, not when it's 4am in North America... and the rest of the year you only need 1/20th the capacity, etc). Other than that, other orgs going to clouds like save money by not having to run datacenters themselves, and not having to retain staff who can run cables and rack servers, install and manage operating systems and dedicated active directory, and network staff, and HVAC, etc etc. Note that some of that still applies to VMs in the cloud, so what people really want to get to is where what they "run" in the cloud is not inside VMs you manage, but rather using abstracted services that are almost automatically scaled and are billed per transaction/operation/per-usage. Azure SQL and App Services and so on. should i tell them to go to UKFast or something similar  Yup, especially if their 10 websites are not high volume or high load. For example if you can fit it into a VPS instead of a dedicated server. VPSs are where savings are at for sites that aren't too big for it, although you (or they, might require application support) want to pay attention to backups and higher availability options. (Never trust a shared web hosting provider's backups, same goes for VPS providers imho, especially the cheaper/fly-by-night ones.) Here's a recent VPS comparison, I've chosen LiquidWeb for a customer in the past, I don't consider them "fly by night". https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2455706,00.asp
