/u/AlienVsRedditors on Build automation with C# and .NET Core
I completely agree. While innovation should never be discouraged, we should also be asking big questions when moving tools for small gains. Change is hard and constant small change is detrimental long term (JavaScript). As much as people bemoan enterprise thinking for being slow, I do think we should be asking ourselves "okay, that's better than what I have. But is it 10% better or 10x better? Is this actually just the new shiny". I'm sure people will say that they always carefully research everything, but that's the danger of shiny. It affects you without you really knowing and nobody wants to admit they are bored or have small bias to new things.
