/u/6beesknees on [EVERYTHING] Is the Night King gray?
Personally I think this is what's likely to happen, although it does seem a bit cliched. The NK didn't ask to be made, or at least we assume he didn't. All we know from the series (can't remember from the books) is that a man was tied to a tree and had a dragonglass dagger plunged into his chest, presumably with magic attached, and the NK was created as a weapon for CotF. He's been like that for over 8 thousand years, plenty of time for snippets of his human character to reassert themselves. I assume that neither the show nor the books will end with NK ascendant, and with all human life turned into his dead army, so 'something' has to happen to stop it. This can only be that he is destroyed, and if he is destroyed I'd assume he would briefly be human again and then crumble to nothing, along with his army. He might even take Melisandre with him, because she's the only character who is been shown to be 'very old'.
