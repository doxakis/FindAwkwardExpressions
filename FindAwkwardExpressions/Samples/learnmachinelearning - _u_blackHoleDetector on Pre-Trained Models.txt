/u/blackHoleDetector on Pre-Trained Models
Depending on the nature of your data, you could fine-tune an existing model to the data you have. The existing model would need to have been trained on data that is somewhat, at least remotely, similar to your data for fine-tuning to make sense. I have a few videos regarding how to do fine-tuning in Keras for image classification using a CNN. The first video on fine-tuning starts here, but the ones before and after it in the Keras playlist help build the whole picture for why using a fine-tuned model is generally a better idea than building a model from scratch if you can.
