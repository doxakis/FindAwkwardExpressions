/u/ffrog on How can I train my computer to notice when a user makes a certain expression with their face?
The thing is the method I am suggesting with not be robust at all. It would honestly fall over in so many ways. For example the shift in light from the helper moving around, the pixel values will change slightly. Honestly would recommend an eye tracking solution of some form of hardware you could rig up to the people. Could you get your friends to help develop a simple eye tracker for mobile?? What you want to solve in terms of vision system isn't a problem that has been solved. Start researching CNNs, Bayesian networks, machine learning etc. And start pushing the cutting edge.
