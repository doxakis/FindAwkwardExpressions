/u/jdwashere on Looking for a managed backup solution of Storage Account Blobs containers
Out of curiosity, have you looked into any of the Microsoft Flow stuff? If you're looking to go straight paas, its similarish to IFTTT. I was poking around with that a bit recently and was able to get basic automation working for blob to blob copy using separate storage accounts. So for new blobs added to a storage account, I could get Flow to automatically copy that blob to another storage account for some redundancy. There are some limitations but that might be worth looking at, and there are a number of other connectors/integrations.
