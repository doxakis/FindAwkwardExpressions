/u/twentyeightyone on Gord Downie, Frontman and vocalist of The Tragically Hip has died.
I grew up in Buffalo, ended up elsewhere, at one point was working with a transplant from Quebec. We were talking about something or other, and I quoted some lyric (I don't even remember which one), and he just about lost his mind. "HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE HIP?" What the hell are you talking about? Everyone knows about the Tragically Hip. "NO THEY DON'T. NOBODY IN THIS PLACE DOES. WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU FROM?" We got along pretty well from then out. It really was like a secret handshake.
