/u/SteveRudzinski on Why was The Thing so hated upon its release?
Because sometimes hate snowballs and it's easier/trendy to hate something. It's why I don't put much focus on reactions of movies that are popular to hate these days or with low RT scores right now. The THing is widely considered one of the greatest horror films ever made. Yet it was nominated for a Razzie? Fuck off. Film enjoyment and quality is entirely subjective and sometimes it takes a while for people to recognize the good things something did.
