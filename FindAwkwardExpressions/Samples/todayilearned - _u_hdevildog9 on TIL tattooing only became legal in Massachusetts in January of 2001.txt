/u/hdevildog9 on TIL tattooing only became legal in Massachusetts in January of 2001 after an almost 40 year ban due to being considered a "crime against the person"
From what I read tattoo artists legitimately couldnt own shops in Massachusetts until 2001. People probably got tattoos by going to other states or doing them under the table but there weren't any shops in MA until '01
