Yup. Why on earth do we want a GPS enabled phone from the other largest advertising firm on the internet? Your desire and mine for a way to connect to others (or have a nice smart phone) is just the hook they use to extract their money through advertising. That's their whole model. In this case with the food, vertical integration lets them sell you ads based not only on where you "check in" but now what you order off of a menu. It also allows them to sell those ads to restaurants that are closest to your tastes. It all seems so greedy and shallow.  I mean, yeah, but salespeople are down around politicians when it comes to scummy manipulative behavior. And any company that is built around ads is going to get scummy at some point.
