/u/DepletedWisdom on Iranian leader urges Europe to defy 'mentally retarded' Donald Trump over nuclear pact
Trump is a con-man. He is what happens if a con-man starts out with money. He has no moral values at all and his fragile ego is fully tied to how he is perceived by others. Hence why even a perceived slightly gets so large a reaction from him. Trump is not a leader of men, but more of a follower. Everything he does in business is as an idea man or investor, with the ideas he insists on becoming bankruptcies for him. Also why he is ineffective as our president. He thinks he can delegate his job to others and go golfing all the time. He manipulated his way into the white house by preying on the fears of the more gulible Americans. Now they would rather eat shit than eat crow. But what was the choice they were given. Trump or Clinton. It was like choosing between a shit sandwich or a shit burrito, but at least the burrito is promising to not give you heartburn.
