/u/ec2-user on Is "Cloud Computing" just applied distributed computing?
This is true. It's also true that the term cloud has been used to describe highly redundant clusters in the past. As cloud became a buzz-word, it took on a marketing definition, and that is what most people think about when they refer to cloud computing today. They are right to do so, yet it also remains true that cloud computing can mean more than just what the hosting and managed services market defines it as, especially when you get into more technical circles. All of this can lead to a great deal of confusion as to what "cloud" really means, but I like to encourage people to adopt the market term and move on, because the moment you are working in the cloud computing industry, the distinction becomes important from a conciseness of communications perspective. Typically when we talk about "cloud" computing, we're talking about a suite of hosting providers (like AWS, Google, and Azure), or hosting platforms that can be installed on premises (like openstack, which I don't recommend, or proprietary technologies like flexiant.) An important characteristic is the provisioning of an api or set of api's for managing resources; with best-of-breed techs leveraging RESTful api's specifically. This provides that on-demand capability to end users that is the key defining characteristic of cloud platforms.
