/u/Gato1980 on Chelsea Handler's Netflix Show Canceled After 2 Seasons
I know she wanted to do something new, but honestly, I absolutely loved her E! show, Chelsea Lately. It had some great, young comedic talent on its roundtable, and Chelsea making fun of celebrities is what I went back to the show for, over and over again. She was trying too hard to take herself seriously on this Netflix show, and it just didn't work. She also came off way too judgmental and preachy to me. Go back to the Chelsea Lately format, and I'd watch in a heartbeat.
