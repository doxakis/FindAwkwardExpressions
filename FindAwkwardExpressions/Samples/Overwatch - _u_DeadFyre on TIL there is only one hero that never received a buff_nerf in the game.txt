/u/DeadFyre on TIL there is only one hero that never received a buff/nerf in the game
She is, IMO, the best-designed Hero in the game. She's got a really high mechanic, a fiendishly high skill-cap, while punishing bad play ruthlessly, yet she still has strong counters. She's high-risk, high reward, and is probably the best 'carry' Hero in the game, but you actually need skills to carry with her. If you can carry on Tracer, you deserve to climb.
