/u/cayneloop on Now that IMT is out, we can expect anything, even G2 making it in
it was not a "keep up at the start". they were ahead in all 3 lanes basically, until they greeded for the mid tower which ended with zven dead and almost all their summoners down which got them on the backfoot for the rest of the midgame where they kept up with until the 2nd baron which ended into a twitch+janna teamfight that lost them the game. if they had won that game, the entire group would had been tied for first and 2nd place and it would force a 3 way tiebraker. one step further would be if samsung actually lost that game vs fenerbache where they played haru, then g2 would had taken samsung's place at this point, even if they would lose both games to them g2 aren't given enough credit for that group just because everyone expected them to not make it out
