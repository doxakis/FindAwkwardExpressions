/u/tzaeru on Scientists may have found a physiological, and seemingly treatable, cause for dyslexia hidden in tiny light-receptor cells in the human eye. In people with dyslexia, the cells were arranged in matching patterns in both eyes, which may be to blame for confusing the brain by producing “mirror” images.
I've a somewhat similar case. Didn't breathe for a while after birth, later diagnosed with dyslexia and now in adulthood going through ADD/ADHD mapping. No big problems in discerning letters/words, but a lot of problems in focus, reading comprehension and motivation. Somehow still ended up pretty well-read and work as a lead programmer, but I'd still be interested in if medicinal or therapy treatment could help me out a little so I could study later in life and get a little tiny bit more out of my time. It's really good to hear others' experiences and stories around dyslexia!
