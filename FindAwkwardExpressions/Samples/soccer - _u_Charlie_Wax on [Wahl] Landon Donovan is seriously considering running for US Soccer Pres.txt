/u/Charlie_Wax on [Wahl] Landon Donovan is seriously considering running for US Soccer President
He's the all-time leader in goals and assists for USMNT. Not hard to see why he'd be considered the best American player. His club career rubs some people the wrong way, but he was nails with the national team. Came up with so many huge goals. Brazil goal in the Confed Cup final. WC 2002 goals. Goals against Algeria and Slovenia in 2010. Penalty against Ghana in 2010. He was a titan for the USA. I don't think he cares if you don't approve of his club career.
