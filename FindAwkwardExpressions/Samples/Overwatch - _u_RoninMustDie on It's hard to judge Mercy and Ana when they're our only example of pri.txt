/u/RoninMustDie on It's hard to judge Mercy and Ana when they're our only example of primary healing - we need more support heroes.
Its true, mercy got a cute design, her voice lines are good, her emotes are funny. But her gameplay is not very appealing, in best case acceptAble once in a while. Compared to Ana, which is not attractively designed, but got a very interesting lore, and her kit + gameplay makes playing support so much more fun and appealing. Design can be a factor, but isnt always the case.
