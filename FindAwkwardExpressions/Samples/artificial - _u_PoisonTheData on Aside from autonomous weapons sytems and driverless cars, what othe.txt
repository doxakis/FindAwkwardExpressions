/u/PoisonTheData on Aside from autonomous weapons sytems and driverless cars, what other form of aritficial intelligence raises issues?
*equity investing *medical decision making (diagnosis, triage, treatment, etc.) *factory robots working alongside humans *policing/surveillance *targeted political messaging *legal representation  ...such an excellent answer. I would add that even weak, pervasive AI will have the effect of hardening the enforcement of rules and regulations that are not policed because they are stupid, (for instance, it is still illegal to ride a bicycle on a tennis court in Boise, Idaho, something even the most basic Computer Vision API's would be capable of doing 24/7/365). Also, there is this troubling sort of corrosive effect AI has on human rights outlined in this paper here. The ti;dr version is that there is legal assumption that a person can be held accountable for a given artefact only to the extent he or she can foresee related risks and consequences. Contrast this with the fact that foreseeing outcomes and risks is increasingly difficult as autonomous and learning AI evolves, hence, you can see the growing danger of a ‘a responsibility gap’. Imagine a Hailiburton made Sentry style robot shooting protesters misidentified as threats. Haliburton could simply say, "We didn't know it was going to do that". It's called the Steve Urkel defense PAPER HERE
