/u/Hudspud5 on Iranian leader urges Europe to defy 'mentally retarded' Donald Trump over nuclear pact
Yeah, because the discussion was totally about number of invasions and not who fucked up the region more. /s There were genocides going in Iraq before the USA invaded. America played a role no doubt but acting like the Middle East would have been a utopia thanks to the carefully planning of their European overlords is laughable. They were hodgepodge states set up without a second glance and filled with people who hated each other. Hell, Syria, the one where all your problems are coming from, is primarily the work of France.
