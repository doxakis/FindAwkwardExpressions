/u/Skanah on Reddit what are some good questions to ask on a first date?
I understand that, the prompt "What are signs that someone is secretly unhappy?" had a similar effect on me. Became shockingly obvious that I was not happy. Like I knew, hey I'm not doing great right now but dozens and dozens of responses that were almost all spot on really shook me, especially the one I linked here.
