/u/cregister on Rant: Microsoft is a failure.
They sure have shoveled a ton of money into the furnace since Gates left. The only market Microsoft still has cornered is a declining market (providing an OS and productivity suite for PC desktops and laptops). Microsoft will always be around in some form or another, but we'll never see the dominant Goliath Microsoft of the 1992-2002 era ever again.
