/u/Cybernetic_Dragon on Fake radio stations in video games have a bigger variety of music than actual radio stations.
I was greatly disappointed to find out in Borderlands 2, that one mission where you have to take the bot around into different bodies until you take it to the radio in Moxxi's Bar, if you leave Sanctuary and return without turning in the mission, the music returns to normal. I was really hoping it'd stay the same joke music the rest of the game :(
