/u/commaway1 on Xi Jinping to China: “Any harm we inflict on nature will eventually return to haunt us”
China was never communist. No offense, but I really wish people on reddit knew their Marxist terminology. China right now would be, in Maoist theory, socialist roading (meaning they're on the path to socialism). More specifically what they are going through is called the Dictatorship of the Proletariat which is a capitalist system where the capitalist class itself is under siege by "tyranny" of the proletariat/working class. The point of this is to ultimately end the existence of private property and eventually the existence of economic inequality altogether.
