Then you take it's height divided by the inverse of the knife blade, times the number of people in the group, but only after everyone gets in a circle and whips out their dicks. You measure each one from base of the shafts to the neck, not all the way to the head. You take that number and count down from 10. With that number, you throw a stone roughly 12.75 ounces as far as you can. Measure the distance then divide by the distance to the moon. Finally, take that final number, plug it into your equation as x. Solve for stab.
