/u/Vandstar on US Congress mulls first 'hack back' revenge law. And yup, you can guess what it'll let people do
Read the PDF a few times,seems like they want to give the victim a bit more leeway to gather data on an attacker. Set boundaries on what you can/can't do when you have access to another computer. The so called access to new tools will probably be very expensive and highly regulated. They use the term "computer defender" quite a lot. Wonder if we might start to see e-commerce/retail security private contractors?
