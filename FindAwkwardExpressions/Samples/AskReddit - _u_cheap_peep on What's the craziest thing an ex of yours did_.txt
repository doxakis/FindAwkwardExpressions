/u/cheap_peep on What's the craziest thing an ex of yours did?
Please, someone don't try to top what my should-be-in-jail ex did: He apparently has chronic masturbation, which explains a tonne of abusive stuff he did later on down the road- but when he was sixteen he decided to try find out if his female dog could orgasm. He used his fingers. Yes, I left pretty damn soon after that.
