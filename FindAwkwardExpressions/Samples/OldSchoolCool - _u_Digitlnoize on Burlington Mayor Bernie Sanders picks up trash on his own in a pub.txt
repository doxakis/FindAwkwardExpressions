/u/Digitlnoize on Burlington Mayor Bernie Sanders picks up trash on his own in a public park after being elected in 1981, his first electoral victory
Not true at all. I'm a moderate independent (former Republican who got fed up with the GOP sucking balls) who is a fervent Bernie supporter. Actually, every REPUBLICAN I know (and I know many, GOP family) would've rather voted for Bernie than Trump, had that been an option. His appeal is broad, not just to progressives.
