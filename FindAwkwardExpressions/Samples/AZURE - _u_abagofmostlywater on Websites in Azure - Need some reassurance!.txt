/u/abagofmostlywater on Websites in Azure - Need some reassurance!
Yes, to be clear. The term "Autoscale" does apply only to scaling out (aka adding duplicates of your app, akin to more VMs) to handle more load. Yes an app would need to consider this in it's architecture however this would be no different than designing for a load balanced environment which you should always do if building a production app you intend to scale (auto or not) To be a bit more clear you can SCALE the app service UP (not OUT) quickly and easily as well and that will not require re-architecture as scaling up is essentially putting it on a more powerful computer. This is not something that can be done in an automated method however you can probably put a runbook on an CPU / MEM alert and set that runbook to scale the app up. Just more things to test... thanks for the clarification /u/adlx
