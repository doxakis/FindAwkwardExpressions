/u/Aquillav on Twitter Was Warned Repeatedly About This Fake Account Run By A Russian Troll Farm And Refused To Take It Down: The account was one of hundreds created by Russia's Internet Research Agency and drew 136,000 followers by tweeting divisive messages in the name of the Tennessee Republican Party.
There’s a big difference between the examples you provided and what the article is referring to. According to the article the accounts were created with the complete knowledge of an agency that’s part of the Russian government  the account impersonated an American citizen  the account openly supported a political party and did so in an attempt to sway the opinions of American voters   There’s nothing wrong with a government owning its own twitter account per se, but if what the article is taking about is true (which I believe it is) then it suggests foul play by the Russian Government. Sure, lots of foreign government twitter accounts will take a stance on an American election, but these accounts impersonated Americans in an attempt to change votes. That’s what makes the Russian effort stand out.
