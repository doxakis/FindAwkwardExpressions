/u/lmouelle on Why we switched from Python to Go
It performs significantly better than Java's default GC these days.  By what metric? Not sure what you mean by compute performance...Throughput, heap overhead, alloc perf, compaction, pause frequency, pause times, etc? Last I checked go optimized for pause times at the expense of nearly everything else, which is appropriate for a narrow class of applications, lacking the ability to fine tune or swap GC that the JVM gives you...
