/u/mloofburrow on What big companies are very lenient on being remote and also are casual about their dress code?
Depends on where you're PMing at. I have a buddy who works for an international company and PMs for their outsourced engineers in another country from the US. He works remotely probably 80% of the time with the other 20% being split between meetings at HQ and travel abroad.
