/u/bloatedplutocrat on Travel ban: Chad added because it ran out of passport paper, US officials say
Very poor country, plenty of political corruption/violence, and the occasional coup. My guess is that their state dept didn't have the money for it because someone in charge of money just took it for themselves and the supply clerk that orders it wasn't able to. That or they were afraid their LGBT citizens were going to leave to another country before they could imprison them.
