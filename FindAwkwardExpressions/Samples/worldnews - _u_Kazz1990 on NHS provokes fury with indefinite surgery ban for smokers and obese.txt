/u/Kazz1990 on NHS provokes fury with indefinite surgery ban for smokers and obese
Ooo, I did that my insurance doesn't cover ambulances for shit and charges a500 copay for the ER so when I sliced the fuck out of my hand (my dog hit me in the balls while I was cutting veggies) I bound that shit up tight called a guy I knew that had Vicodin to get one and waited for urgent care to open to get my stitches. Saved me 450$ in copays not to mention the ERs always over charge like a bitch.
