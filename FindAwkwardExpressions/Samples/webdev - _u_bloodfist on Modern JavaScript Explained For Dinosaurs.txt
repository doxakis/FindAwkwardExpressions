/u/bloodfist on Modern JavaScript Explained For Dinosaurs
I'd say average. She knows her way around a computer and plays PC games but calls for help if there is anything more complicated than changing Wi-Fi networks. But she's pretty artistically minded. She paints and likes interior design, so the HTML/CSS part has been very fun and intuitive for her. We just barely started and took a week or two off since we've both been busy but so far it's been a lot of fun. I think she's going to get frustrated once we get to JS and she has to start thinking about things like Boolean logic and loops. That's why I'm focusing on getting her comfortable with the more "right-brain" parts so the "left-brain" parts feel like giving her room to be creative, instead of just loading a whole bunch of stuff that is going to look like math on her. Although, to be honest, she's better at math than me, so maybe she'll enjoy that too.
