/u/Frognaldamus on Why don't the Browns just sign Kap?
Collusion to lower players salaries I can see. That makes sense. Winning games = money. 28/32 owners in the league would sign him if they thought it would help them win more games. Put all the hysteria and echo chamber nonsense aside, and I don't think that owners allow players like Greg Hardy to be signed because they actively support domestic violence and psychopathic behaviour. They let them be signed because it's all about winning games and making money. On top of that, you have teams like the Seahawks who are very vocal and active about letting their players speak their mind and trumpet their own causes. I'm sure the Seahawks aren't the only team that allows that, just the team I'm most familiar with that does. Seahawks interviewed him, had a need for a backup QB, and ultimately decided to pass. All of that being said: The owners have been found to have colluded before, so it's not out of the question that it happened again. You could also say that Kaep was directly threatening those $$ with his actions, so shrug. Even if it is ruled collusion, we'll never know the real answer.
