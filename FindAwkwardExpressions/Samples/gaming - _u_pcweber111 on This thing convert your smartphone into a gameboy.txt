Ok to all the people saying "why not just use a real Gameboy", etc. You're missing the point. It's just a cool hack and there's something neat about using the original carts to play on a new phone. Its like the past meets the future. Plus you get physical controls which is preferable. Again it's just a neat hack no need to be a bunch of Debbie downers.
