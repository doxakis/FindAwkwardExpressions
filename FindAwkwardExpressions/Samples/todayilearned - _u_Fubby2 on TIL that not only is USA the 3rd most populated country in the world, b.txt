/u/Fubby2 on TIL that not only is USA the 3rd most populated country in the world, but if it had ONE BILLION MORE people, it would still be the 3rd most populated country in the world.
Overpopulation is an issue in the same way that humans existing at all is an issue. Humans in an industrialized society WILL have a negative impact on the surrounding environment. Does that mean humans are an issue? Should we get rid of them all as an optimal solution to the human existence problem? As it stands we produce enough food to feed the planet, and many countries live in a manner that, if all countries lived in the same way, would be environmentally sustainable. If we want to practically reduce environmental destruction, it would be better to tackle issues like this: [Americans] make up 5 percent of the global population, but use 20 percent of the world's energy. We eat 15 percent of the world's meat. We produce 40 percent of the world's garbage.  Reducing the vast over consumption in developed nations is a much more achievable goal than dealing with a vague concept of "Overpopulation". What I mean to say, is our current population is essentially sustainable if everyone were to massively reduce consumption.
