/u/SushiMage on Who is the scariest movie character you can think of?
I see the rational behind that idea but I still don't think it's a strong one if you look at it carefully. The difference with the wife is that he promised he would kill her.  Yes, but he's shown to just outright kill people without any form of hesitation when he wants to and has zero remorse or even deep thoughts behind it. Shooting the mexican hitmen, shooting the bird, shooting the driver of the car, in all of those scenarios he just does it. When it comes to killing when he wants to, he'll just do it. I think he would have just shot her if he was that convicted in killing her in the name of the promise instead of posturing with her for no real reason. With Carson, he wanted the suitcase. With her there's nothing. What would be the point of bringing up a coin toss if he was going to follow his promise the entire time. In fact, citing the promise as a reasoning doesn't seem particularly strong. Because at least for honoring the coin toss we have some precedent. Him keeping his promises with complete loyalty and conviction went out the window when he shoots his employers. Him choosing promises over a coin toss has no real precedent to it. It's obviously not falsifiable within the confines of the film, but I think it's fair to say that his coin toss offers are genuine. In fact he seemed miffed when she refused. I'm saying you don't have enough information to know one way or another.  Of course, but there's still better leanings towards one direction over the other. I don't think every scenario in an ambiguous situation is always flat-even in possibility.
