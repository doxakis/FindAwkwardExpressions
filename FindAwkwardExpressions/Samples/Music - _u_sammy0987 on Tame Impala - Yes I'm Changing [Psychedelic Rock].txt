/u/sammy0987 on Tame Impala - Yes I'm Changing [Psychedelic Rock]
I love Tame Impala, but those lyrics read like something a creative writing student would have written in sophomore year. Like I said, I love this band, but I've never thought Parker's lyrics were terribly strong. I know, I know....the downvotes are coming.
