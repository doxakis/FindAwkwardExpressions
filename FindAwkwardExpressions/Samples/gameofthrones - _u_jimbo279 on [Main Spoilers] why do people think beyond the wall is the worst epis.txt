/u/jimbo279 on [Main Spoilers] why do people think beyond the wall is the worst episode of the series?
Everyone else pretty much covered everything, but I want to add that them writing Benjen off like that was terrible. Not only was it deus ex machina for Jon, but the whole "THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME" so they could conveniently kill off Benjen was terrible. They just didn't know what to do with Benjen. He served as deus ex machina for Bran and Jon before they just said "screw it" and killed him off because there just isn't enough time left in the show for him to amount to anything. Very lazy writing and i'm disappointed that the show couldn't do Benjen justice.
