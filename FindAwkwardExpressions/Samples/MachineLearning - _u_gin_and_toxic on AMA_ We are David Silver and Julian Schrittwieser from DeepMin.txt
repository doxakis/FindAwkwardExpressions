/u/gin_and_toxic on AMA: We are David Silver and Julian Schrittwieser from DeepMindâ€™s AlphaGo team. Ask us anything.
Hi David, saw the movie recently. You're especially hilarious when trolling everyone at the end of the last game. It's great to see all of your team's struggles and point of view than what we saw on the stream last year. Questions: What are members of previous AlphaGo team working on now that you can tell us? Are everyone still working on different variations of AlphaGo, or are you moving on to something else? If you were to give AlphaGo an avatar, what would you personally choose? Thanks for the AMA.
