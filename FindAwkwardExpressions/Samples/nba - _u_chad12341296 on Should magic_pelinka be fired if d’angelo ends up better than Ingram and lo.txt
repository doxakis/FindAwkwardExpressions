/u/chad12341296 on Should magic/pelinka be fired if dâ€™angelo ends up better than Ingram and lonzo and the Lakers fail to acquire a superstar FA?
D'angelo was low key the only player last year who cared about actually playing to win instead of "developing" or showing out for a contract, and on the court it seemed as though players were for some reason irritated with him for that, if he ends up much better than them that becomes a bigger narrative.
