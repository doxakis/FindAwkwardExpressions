/u/riceronijabroni on [D] Classifying Data With No Discernible Differences
Makes sense. Also interesting that it would come down to that. I suppose trying to approximate a players elo is a better way to determine what league people are in... Perhaps my best options is to try to find some more variables that stand out and do multiple regression. So far the only two variables that stand out with noticeable disparities between the tiers are game length and cs. Masters and Challenger games average shorter and cs averages higher. However, the other tiers have more similar game lengths and cs lol...
