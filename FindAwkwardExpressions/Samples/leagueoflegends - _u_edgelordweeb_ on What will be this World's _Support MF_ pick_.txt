/u/edgelordweeb_ on What will be this World's "Support MF" pick?
you might be right about leona because rng's support ming plays leona and has a few games on it in pro play and he's really good at leona too. wouldn't be too surprised if he brought it out although with all the shielding in this meta it's a pretty questionable pick
