/u/hesh582 on Chipotle downgraded by Bank of America on new concern: It's paying employees too much
This is basic accounting stuff. 27% cost of labor in a fast casual business means hold off investing for now. I think you might be reading a bit much into this - BOA is not forcing chipotle to do anything. This is just investor guidance. Anyway, Chipotle knows this already. That's a pretty unacceptable labor number - they're going to work to run more efficiently regardless of whether the bank says anything.
