/u/andrebires on Open source sets sights on killing WhatsApp and Slack
We tried this exact library but it didn't supported async IO and for us it was a deal breaker. The number of commits in a repository do not represent the size of any software. Our library was functional after few weeks of implementation and since then we are improving the communication, transport, performance and related stuff. We rarelly add a new protocol feature. You can check the specification updates here: https://github.com/takenet/lime If you want to compare the complexity, just look at the XMPP core specification and compare with the one that I provided in my previous comment: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6121/?include_text=1 But you know, XMPP is pratically unusable without its extensions (XEPs). And there are so many XEPs (https://xmpp.org/extensions/) that you have almost a new protocol depending of the active XEPs in a server. Our protocol just defines the frame format using JSON (which is a lot easier to work compared with XML) and the basic client / server behavior, which was what we needed.
