As you mentioned, you've been away from the jailbreaking scene for a few years, and things have changed dramatically. Also, shameless plug, but if anyone is interested in any sort of jailbreaking information, whether it be tweaks or simply how to jailbreak your device, feel free to stop by /r/jailbreak. I'm a mod there and we've got a very active community ready to answer any questions or give whatever advice you're looking for.
