/u/N2theO on Napa.js - multi-threaded JavaScript runtime built on V8 (from Microsoft)
I wouldn't really consider my comment attacking you any more than your comment was attacking the previous poster. Your comments come off as extremely arrogant actually. Your age doesn't mean anything if you spent all of the time not learning anything new.   I've programmed professionally in Ruby, C++, Java, Javascript, Typescript, Go, Python, Groovy, and have learned more frameworks than I could possibly list. I'm currently working on a cross platform mobile app with react-native on the frontend, Golang on the backend, Kubernetes for container management, etc. Is that bleeding edge enough for you? I am also self taught, I also don't have a college degree, and I make a silly amount of money because I'm damn good at my job. It's hard to be impressed by the Node ecosystem because it's not really a step up from the tools that have been in use for decades. Can you explain why NPM is a huge step up over Maven? How about the benefits of ExpressJS vs. Jax-RS vs. Flask? Can you explain where Javascript excels as a language vs. other language? Imagine how much more you will know in ten years if you keep that thirst for knowledge. That might help you realize how arrogant you come off as. edit For funsies I've also dabbled in Lisp, Scala, Clojure, Haskell, Erlang, and several others I'm drawing a blank on.
