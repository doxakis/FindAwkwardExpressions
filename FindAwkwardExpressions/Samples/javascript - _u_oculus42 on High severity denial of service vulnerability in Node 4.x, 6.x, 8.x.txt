/u/oculus42 on High severity denial of service vulnerability in Node 4.x, 6.x, 8.x
7.x is an unstable release (following the Linux standard of even = stable), and is essentially the abandoned early releases of 8.x before it was stable enough to use an even number. If the issue is zlib—which I cannot say with any degree of certainty—the switch happened during the 7.x development period. All of this aside, I would not recommend using any odd-numbered release in production.
