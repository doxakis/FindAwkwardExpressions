/u/T800Architect on Advice: Interviews are not 100% technical.
I don't show this in interviews. In interviews I am polite, yet uncertain. Besides, what else am I supposed to do? I am in the middle of a battlefield surrounded by sworn enemies - they swore to be my enemies, not me - after a lifetime of finding even one ally and failing; what would you have me do? Am I simply damned to feel their blades enter my flesh? If I surrender, they will torture me as long as my body will hold out. You offered advice; where is it? Or was that yet another lie?
