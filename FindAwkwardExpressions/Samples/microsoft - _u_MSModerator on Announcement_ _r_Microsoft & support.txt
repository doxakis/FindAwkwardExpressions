Hello. Sorry for the delayed response. Since Razer holds the hardware warranty our store manager is correct in stating they would be responsible for servicing it. Here is a link to the Razer Limited Warranty and a link to their support line: (https://www.razerzone.com/warranty#a4) (http://support.razerzone.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade/) Hope this helps. Cheers.
