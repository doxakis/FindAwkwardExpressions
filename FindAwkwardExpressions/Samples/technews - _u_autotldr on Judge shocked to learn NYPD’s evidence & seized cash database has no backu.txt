/u/autotldr on Judge shocked to learn NYPD’s evidence & seized cash database has no backup. All data would be lost if PETS’ DB2 server went down or data corrupted.
This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 69%. (I'm a bot) As part of an ongoing legal battle to get the New York City Police Department to track money police have grabbed in cash forfeitures, an attorney for the city told a Manhattan judge on October 17 that part of the reason the NYPD can't comply with such requests is that the department's evidence database has no backup. If the database servers that power NYPD's Property and Evidence Tracking System-designed and installed by Capgemini under a $25.5 million contract between 2009 and 2012-were to fail, all data on stored evidence would simply cease to exist. When told by Giovanatti that the police department's IT department did not keep backups and only knew that the database "Is in IBM," Judge Bluth responded, "Do you want the Daily News to be reporting that you have no copy of the data?... That deserves an exposé in the New York Times."  Extended Summary | FAQ | Feedback | Top keywords: data#1 Department#2 City#3 database#4 NYPD#5
