/u/mereh2o on [S3] A theory - A burned hut beyond the wall
The white walker Sam killed has a very distinctive costume that supports this. He's bearded like a wildling and is nearly naked, wearing burnt tatters of clothing compared to the well-dressed companions of the Night King. If this is true, I can see where mass burnings by dragon fire might can make the situation worse. Season 8 is going to be very interesting, isn't it?
