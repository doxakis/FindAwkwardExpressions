/u/catmeow321 on A North Korean defector says the regime is crippled by sanctions and won't last a year.
China will never annex NK. China doesn't want Korean territory, look how angry the Koreans are at the Japanese, does China want to be the next "Japan" in the Korean's mind? No. It prefer for unified Korea to be pro-China and anti-Japan. If SK can offer complete eviction of US troops and anti-Japan alignment, then perhaps China will allow, but if SK is pro-US and pro-Japan, then why bother? If China handed NK to SK in exchange for a China-Korea alliance against Japan, eviction of US troops, would SK accept it?
