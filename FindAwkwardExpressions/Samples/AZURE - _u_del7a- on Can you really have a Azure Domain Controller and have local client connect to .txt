/u/del7a- on Can you really have a Azure Domain Controller and have local client connect to it
Servers and workstations connect to a domain controllers in the same site as determined by sites and services and if they arent available then they try for other domain controllers. It treats the domain controller in Azure the same as any other domain controller. The VPN connection to Azure means your network/domain treats Azure the same as any other on prem servers. However if you want to just create an Azure VM with a public IP and access it over the internet without a VPN then thats probably not going to work.
