/u/VGPowerlord on AngularJs vs Razor
Basically, modern web development is split into two camps. Uses server-side technologies for its controllers and views and has JavaScript in its views to do dynamic stuff.MvM and Razor are the ASP.NET server-side technologies used for this. Client-side technologies may include things like jQuery or Dojo. May also include SignalR, which is technically both a server-side and client-side technology.   Uses server-side technologies to expose REST endpoints. Client-side technologies are used to do controllers and views.WebAPI is the ASP.NET server-side technology used for this. Client-side technologies may include things like AngularJS or React.    There's a whole huge argument about which of these are better. Side note: Visual Studio's templates don't include authentication for WebAPI despite JWT Bearer Tokens being supported by the version of ASP.NET Identity included in .NET Core. JWT Bearer Tokens being the most common form of authentication to use with REST services.
