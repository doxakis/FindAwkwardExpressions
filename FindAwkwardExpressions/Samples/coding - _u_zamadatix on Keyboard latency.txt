/u/zamadatix on Keyboard latency
The "where is the latency coming from?" section is a bit odd, in the previous section the author dismisses 3.5 ms savings as being useless but spends 2 paragraphs talking about 10 ms travel time (with detailed investigation) yet ends it with a few short sentences on the (presumed?) main causes with no investigation, device comparisons, or data. For someone that started off complaining about claims without benchmarks not much was added other than "keys with less travel take less time to press" which does nothing for finding a fast keyboard that doesn't murder your hands in use.
