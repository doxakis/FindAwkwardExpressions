Does this prevent the following scenario, and if it does not, what recourse does an ill-informed individual user have to restore their system? 1) An ill-informed user (A) gains a virus or malicious piece of software that allows a different user (B) machine access. 2) User (B) "hacks" website (C). 3) Anti-hack department (one or more individuals on behalf of C) then "hack-back" and destroy all data on user (A)'s machine (including any data that may or may not have been mined, likely copied and sent to B's system already).
