(I'm a bot) Currently, the FCC's "Form 477" data collection program requires Internet service providers to identify the census blocks in which they provide residential or business Internet service and the maximum speeds offered in each block. While a census block is the smallest geographic unit used by the US Census Bureau, it doesn't provide the best possible data for determining whether an individual house or apartment building has Internet service.
