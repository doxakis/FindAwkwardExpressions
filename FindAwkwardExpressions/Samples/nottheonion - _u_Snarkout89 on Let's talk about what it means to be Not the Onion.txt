/u/Snarkout89 on Let's talk about what it means to be Not the Onion
It's pretty important for the mods to not turn on each other, but /u/elfa82 is being downright petulant, and that's become the main feature of this thread. As long as one mod is proudly boasting of what an asshole he is and attempting to prove he doesn't care what people think of him by drawing as much attention to himself as he can, any notion that this thread is about legitimate discussion sounds hollow.
