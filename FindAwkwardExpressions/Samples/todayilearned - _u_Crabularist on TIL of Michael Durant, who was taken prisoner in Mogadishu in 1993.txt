/u/Crabularist on TIL of Michael Durant, who was taken prisoner in Mogadishu in 1993. He was tortured for 11 days until he heard a helicopter playing "Hell's Bells" by AC/DC. His superiors knew it was his favorite song, so they had rigged a helicopter with a loudspeaker and flown over the city looking for him.
That was a max landis impersonation.
