/u/dkmanic on Napa.js - multi-threaded JavaScript runtime built on V8 (from Microsoft)
I've been a developer for 25+ years and used to feel like this. I found that I was bringing along some mental baggage because of my experience. That was interfering.

Thinking in the functional way JS encourages has even helped me to make better use of the functional and dynamic features that were brought into C#.
