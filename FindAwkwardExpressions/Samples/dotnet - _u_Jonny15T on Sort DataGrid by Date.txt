/u/Jonny15T on Sort DataGrid by Date
Just got into the office. Gave that a try but unfortunately it didn't work. I've tried:  Binding="{Binding cal_date, StringFormat=MM/dd/yyyy}"/> Binding="{Binding cal_date, StringFormat='MM/dd/yyyy'}"/> Binding="{Binding cal_date, StringFormat=d}"/> Binding="{Binding cal_date, ConverterCulture='en-US', StringFormat=d}"/> Binding="{Binding cal_date, StringFormat={}{0:MM/dd/yyyy}}"/> Binding="{Binding cal_date, StringFormat='{}{0:MM/dd/yyyy}'}"/>  I've also tried copying and pasting directly from Reddit and StackOverflow posts where they said it's working to no avail. I did read somewhere that someone was only able to get it to work when binding to a text property, however, I've tried creating a templated column and binding to a text block text property and it still didn't work. I don't know what I'm doing wrong... EDIT: Found a solution by using an IValueConverter during the binding process. XAML:    C#:  class ISO8061toENUSConverter : IValueConverter { public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture) { if (value is string) { var dt = DateTime.Parse(value.ToString()); return dt.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy"); } return string.Empty; } public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } }
