/u/yudoit on How to practise JS on a daily basis?
I build a webapp for make magazines (like indesign), i think you can't go very deep in js without go very deep in css and html5. I mean, you can learn really a lot about the software using the books, but the real problem is the true work with tons of different objects and interactions. To manage multiple pages, texts, text-flow in columns, rotation of objects, group objects and the mouse interactions when rollover multiple object with totally different properties. If you want a daily practise, do an app that produce something and try to see if you (and your users) can work for hours with your app crash or stuck in a loop.
