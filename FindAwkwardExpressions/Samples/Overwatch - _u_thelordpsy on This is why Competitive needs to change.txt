/u/thelordpsy on This is why Competitive needs to change
The problem is that these SR losses have been completely out of my control  This is an easy way to shift blame and fail to improve. No matter what, assume that the loss is your fault and focus on what you could have done to play better and help your team win. Even during wins, think of what you could have done to seal the victory earlier or better. Or just assume that it's the system, it's not your fault, and keep believing that without changing anything about yourself, the game will magically reward you.
