/u/gimmeslack12 on Finished my portfolio, would love a critique!
The main thought I had was what on the page have you specifically built versus using some library? Here are some good projects to approach from here on out: Build that your own typed.js. Deconstruct typed.js if you want. Build the parts of it that you need, not the whole thing.  Next, build a image carousel yourself, use jQuery if you want but don't use flickity.js  Start using CodePen to quickly be able to get some ideas out. The idea is to just build things, just to try them out.   They don't have to be super impressive the goal here is to show off that you're learning. That right there is marketable to employers. Also on your resume take off being a cashier at Chipotle. It's irrelevant and padding your resume isn't necessary.
