/u/SecretAg3nt on [R] AlphaGo Zero: Learning from scratch | DeepMind
Speaking as someone with no domain knowledge, it seems like shedding the "bias" of learning from professional humans allowed this algorithm to develop novel strategies. Notably, although supervised learning achieved higher move prediction accuracy, the self-learned player performed much better overall, defeating the human-trained player within the first 24 h of training. This suggests that AlphaGo Zero may be learning a strategy that is qualitatively different to human play.
