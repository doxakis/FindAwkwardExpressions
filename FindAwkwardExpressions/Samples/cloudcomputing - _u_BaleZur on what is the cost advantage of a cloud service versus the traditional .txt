/u/BaleZur on what is the cost advantage of a cloud service versus the traditional hosted enterprise server set up?
That is a good link to get you info on a ballpark of what it will cost to run in a cloud service. However you also wanted to know roughly what it costs to do a 'traditional' hosted setup. That totally depends on whom you would be getting your hosting from. However if you are considering in-house/on-prem hosting then you'll need to consider things like internet connections, UPS, backup generators, security, cost of mains power for computers, and cost of mains power for AC to cool computers. Depending on how you slice it DR costs as well. Take a look at https://www.expedient.com/data-center-build-vs-buy-calculator/ (honestly I just googled 'calculate the cost of running a datacenter') for an idea on where to start for those numbers.
