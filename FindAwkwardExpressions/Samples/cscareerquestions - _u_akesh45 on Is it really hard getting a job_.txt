/u/akesh45 on Is it really hard getting a job?
I've sent out 20 resumes and have received zero interviews,  That's a low amount for a job search... Especially since some job listing are recruiters advertising the same role thus duplicates. Im a mid level dev and did 20 alone yesterday (along with tons of calls and interviews), gonna send out another 50+ unless somebody flash hires me.
