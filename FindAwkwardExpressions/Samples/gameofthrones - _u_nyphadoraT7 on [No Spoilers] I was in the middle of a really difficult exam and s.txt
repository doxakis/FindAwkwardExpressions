/u/nyphadoraT7 on [No Spoilers] I was in the middle of a really difficult exam and some kidâ€™s phone goes off; his ringtone was the Rains of Castamere. Everyone that knew it erupted into laughter, I thought it was funny and fitting. Just thought Iâ€™d share :)
I'm always trying to play these songs in my car with the kids but they start crying and saying the music is scary ðŸ˜’.
