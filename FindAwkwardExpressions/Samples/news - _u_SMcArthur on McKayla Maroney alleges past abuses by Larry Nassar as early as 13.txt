/u/SMcArthur on McKayla Maroney alleges past abuses by Larry Nassar as early as 13
These lawyers know for a fact that whatever Larry Nassar did to these children's vaginas and assholes is not accepted medical practice, and they know for a fact that no judge or jury would ever accept that explanation either.  As a defense lawyer, you don't have medical judgment anyway. You get an expert witness to testify that it is or is not accepted practice. If you don't have any expert witnesses that will testify to that, then that's your excuse for not putting the defense on. If you do, then you put up that expert. It's not lying to the court. You are hiding behind this "I'm an attorney" bullshit, but I doubt you are an actual litigator or this shit would be common knowledge to you.
