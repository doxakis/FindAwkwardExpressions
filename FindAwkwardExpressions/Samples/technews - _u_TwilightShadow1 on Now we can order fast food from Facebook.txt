/u/TwilightShadow1 on Now we can order fast food from Facebook
I get that facebook wants to be a part of everyone's lives, but all I ever wanted out of it was a convenient way to see what my friends were up to, and keep in touch with oversees family. Why on earth do I need it to replace ebay/amazon/every fast food ordering app/snapchat/Instagram/youtube/news sites plus anything else I've forgotten! Now it doesn't even feel good as a social media platform, let alone all of the half-assed additional systems that they've added. It all seems so greedy and shallow.
