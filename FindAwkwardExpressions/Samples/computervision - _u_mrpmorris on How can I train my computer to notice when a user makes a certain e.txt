/u/mrpmorris on How can I train my computer to notice when a user makes a certain expression with their face?
Well, for obvious reasons I can fix the pose, because the user won't be able to move. I can't fix the lighting, but if the calibration process only takes a couple of seconds then it won't be a problem if the helper has to reinitiate that calibration process whenever the software struggles to pick up indications (such as when the lighting has changed). With that in mind, is there anything you can suggest? RE: Tobii pro. I recently discovered two of my friends work there :) I have one of those but, unfortunately, my friend's eyes are incompatible with it. Besides, I want to develop an app for mobile devices, not desktops. Thanks
