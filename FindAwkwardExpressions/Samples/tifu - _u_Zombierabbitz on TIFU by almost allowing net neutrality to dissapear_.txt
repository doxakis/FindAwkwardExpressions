/u/Zombierabbitz on TIFU by almost allowing net neutrality to dissapear.
When I called they just asked for my name, address and phone number. I just gave them my first name cuz I left a message but I plan on calling again and talking directly. I'm home sick I got allllllll day to be on hold and my phone is on the charger so bring it on!
