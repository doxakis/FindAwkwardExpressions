/u/Josef_Eichmann on This Korean globe which doesn't have North or South Korea, just a single Korea
Don't feed our mild sides to this communist propaganda. Clearly, this is an Illuminati conspiracy to create one world under the rule of Kim Jong Un. It starts off with Korea and soon will expand to China and then the rest of Asia. Then Europe, then Africa, and the U.S and then the whole world will be under Kim Jong Un's regimen. Delete this post or else the whole world will be the North Korea. I do not think you want that to happen. The only positive outcome would be that we would all have fast internet and Redstar OS JK, this is hilarious
