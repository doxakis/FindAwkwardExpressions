/u/maxou783 on Solution for Occlusion problem
A very naive way to do this would be to binarize your images in order to segment the pieces of cotton you need to detect. If the images you have to process are all similar to the ones you provided, the cotton pieces are clearly whiter than anything else in your image. Therefore you could select a high threshold in order to binarize your image. Then you could use morphological operations to smooth your segmentation. If it works well you can detect occlusions when your segmentation produces only one area instead of two. Hope it helps!
