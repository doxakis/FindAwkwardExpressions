/u/vannak139 on How to calculate a CNN to deal with 21x21 images (similar to MNIST) but with only 3 classes?
If you're getting mismatched tensors, that's probably because you're trying to apply something like a 2x2 conv layer to a 1x1 input tensor. You should rethink the convolutional structure from scratch. If you're not using padding, strides or dilation, then the [output size = input size - (n-1)] where n is the conv size. If you use a pooling layer, [output size = FLOOR(input size / pool size)] Here is an example model:  input [outputs 21x21] Conv(3x3) [outputs 19x19] MaxPool(2, 2) [outputs 9x9] Conv(4x4) [outputs 6x6] etc.  My preference is to downsample to a single pixel with a number of features = to output classes. Then flatten and softmax.
