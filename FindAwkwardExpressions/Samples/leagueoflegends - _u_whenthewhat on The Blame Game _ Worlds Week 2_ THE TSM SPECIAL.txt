/u/whenthewhat on The Blame Game | Worlds Week 2: THE TSM SPECIAL
Tired of this non-sense defending the drafts. If your team is monumentally failing, TRY SOMETHING. Zero first bloods, losing every early game? GIVE SVEN LEE AND SEE WHAT HE CAN DO. Yes, they were fundamentally bad at everything. When you are failing monumentally, you don't keep repeating yourself expecting different results. Leave that galio open, see if you can pick it. Losing every janna vs lulu matchup regardless of whichever you have? Pick that thresh that your support is known for. This is lazy bullshit reasoning that is the reason why TSM chokes at every international tournament.
