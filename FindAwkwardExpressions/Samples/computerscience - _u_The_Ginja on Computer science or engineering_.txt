/u/The_Ginja on Computer science or engineering?
The only math class CS majors at my school don't have to take is differential equations. If you go to Colorado state it will be vvveerrrryyy similar curriculum. I just left an interview for an internship with some people who go to CSU and they take the same classes I do. From my understanding computer engineering is going to be more hardware than it is programming. If you want to be a developer you should go CS. If you want to design computer components either go electrical engineering or computer engineering.
