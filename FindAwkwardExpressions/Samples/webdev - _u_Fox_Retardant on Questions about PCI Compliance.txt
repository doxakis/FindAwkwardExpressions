/u/Fox_Retardant on Questions about PCI Compliance
Maybe it's my ignorance but I'm not sure where you are getting that VPS and cloud hosting are in anyway an issue with SAQ A, do you have any more information on this? I'm also confused about where you say that asking for CVV breaches PCI compliance. Of course it can't be stored, but if you never ask for it then it could never be validated...? I find 'see' a strange word in this context. Sorry, this is now really out of order but I think you're confused on the different SAQ levels as well. It is SAQ A which is for use with fully hosted payment providers, SAQ C isn't even for e-commerce channels, it's for POS that are connected to the internet.
