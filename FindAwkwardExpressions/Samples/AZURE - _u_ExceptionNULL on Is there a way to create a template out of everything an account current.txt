/u/ExceptionNULL on Is there a way to create a template out of everything an account currently has setup in Azure’s portal? (Note: it is just a website shell environment)
I agree. Though having VS ’17 Enterprise, I prefer VS Code and it’s tooling for working with ARM templates. Use this and make sure you add the user snippets for JSON in the preferences section. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools If using powershell, keep in mind that a lot of times things won’t work due to the confusion of ASM and ARM and the respective modules you need to use. Even non classic resources have elements that can/need to be managed under ASM modules even though you’ve setup using RG’s/ARM.
