/u/Shadow3ragon on Fungus destroyed inmateâ€™s brain while Kansas prison contractor did nothing, suit says
They should have lifelong learning too, as they do in the medical field, on your own time, to maintain a license. Frankly, 7 years medical training, should put you way above the rest in a multi-disciplinary dimension. The things covered in the medical fields, range from a wide array of issues too, from ethics, how to treat people, clients. Maintain professionalism. Some things are just not existent in enforcement by many officers. I would like to see, more academic training, as well as higher pay for officers, to make it a lot more competitive. Unless they are special unit.. Many of them aren't exactly in peak physical condition anyways. Some of them it feels, like they just put on a badge and boom, they are officers. I mean de-escalation training, should be vital too. And when you learn that, you can actually communicate with people. If you look at the UK, their officers, for the most part don't even carry guns. (Although as long as the second ammendment is a thing, it will always endanger officers, and other civilians, weather they acknowledge it or not).
