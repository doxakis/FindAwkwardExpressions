/u/mike168m on Computer science or engineering?
The math prerequisites for Computer Science across the board is more flexible when compared to Computer Engineering. Comp Sci math includes the following as the bare minimum. Calculus 1 & 2  Discrete Math  Statistics   Apart from this the school may require the student to choose between Linear Algebra, Calculus 3 or Differential Equations But Computer Engineering will require all of the above. If you want to work on hardware at a much lower level like embedded systems then you should choose Computer Engineering. If you want to work on Distributed systems, Operating Systems, Compilers or anything related to AI you can choose CS and you'll be fine. You just won't have as much knowledge as a Computer Engineering Student would about hardware. You should also think about ease of transition to other closely related fields like Robotics or Electrical Engineering, in which case Computer Engineering will make t a lot easier for you to transition to those fields later in life.
