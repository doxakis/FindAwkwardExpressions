I don't really care whether they get posted or not, but that's a pretty narcissistic and pessimistic view of it. Because they might actually, you know, be fans of the organization? Liked their players? Watched their games? Want to tell them that they enjoyed their presence? That video is funny, but honestly rather stupid. Raising awareness DOES raise money, and posting your support of things DOES influence people. People here can't magically band together and get IMT inducted into the league, but that doesn't mean they don't care that they're missing. It's not really hard to wrap your mind around why people would make these threads or post in them.
