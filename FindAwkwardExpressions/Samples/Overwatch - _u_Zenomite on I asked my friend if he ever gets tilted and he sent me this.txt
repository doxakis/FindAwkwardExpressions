/u/Zenomite on I asked my friend if he ever gets tilted and he sent me this
no, I feel you lol. I believe the general consensus on how earth shatter works is that it stuns everyone within Reinhardt's FOV to a certain range. It can be blocked by walls and shields but not changes in elevation or the cart. It is limited by line of sight. The height of the cone appears to be limited to Reinhardt's height himself. The visual effect is incredibly misleading. I actually dunno if the earth shatter in the video was "supposed" to hit. It seems like the Mccree is slightly too high and slightly too far away. Edit: sorry about about the disjointed message, I'm sorta tipsy and I was doing a flurry of Googling to make sure most of what I heard was at least mostly agreed on in the forums.
