/u/BRAF-V600E on Would it be possible to apply t-SNE to my data?
Wow, there's some great information here! This is much better feedback than I thought possible when posting my initial question, and I'll probably rely heavily on this method when developing my own project, thanks! I have two small additional questions that you can hopefully answer, both involving the initial data set. I noticed that you only looked at commenters, not authors. Do you think that looking at the two user types together as one would produce noise in the analysis? I was originally planning on grouping the two, but now I'm thinking it would be best to just use commenters as you have done. Secondly, when constructing my own commenter overlap, is my logic sound in that I should first identify 1000 or more random commenters and then identify the last 1000 or so subreddit's that they have posted too? I'm thinking a good way to get random commenters is to just sort reddit by new and scrape comments of each post until I have 1000. I'm also interested in seeing your BigQuery code on github, but the link isn't working.
