/u/ravengenesis1 on Vietnam vet died at VA hospital while nurseâ€™s aide played video games on computer
You'll rather have someone who can work a code, than someone who might be holding back the responders. It's actually not wrong to back out when you know you can't do it. ICU nurse doesn't mean they can handle codes, because there's code responses that'll run them. Should the ICU nurse help, totally.. but if her skills ain't polished, then she shouldn't get in the way.
