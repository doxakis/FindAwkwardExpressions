I am a bot! You linked to a paper that has a summary on ShortScience.org! http://www.shortscience.org/paper?bibtexKey=journals/corr/1612.08083 Summary Preview: This paper is about a new model for language which uses a convolutional approach instead of LSTMs. General Language modeling Statistical language models estimate the probability distribution of a sequence of words. They are important for ASR (automatic speech recognition) and translation. The usual approach is to embedd words into $\mathbb{R}n$ and then apply RNNs to the vector sequences.
