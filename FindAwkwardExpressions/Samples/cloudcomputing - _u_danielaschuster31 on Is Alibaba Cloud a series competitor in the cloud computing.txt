/u/danielaschuster31 on Is Alibaba Cloud a series competitor in the cloud computing space?
I think of the Alibaba offering as non-USA centric. Alibaba is very popular in China, so their expanding into cloud space is a parallel to Amazon in the US. And they have a huge customer base. While many countries look at the US as the center of technology, it is easy to forget that there are billions of people who look elsewhere, or have fewer choices. Offering the same variety of computing services in other large countries is logical. I don't know if Alibaba will make major inroads into the US or European cloud market, it's too early to tell. I do think a consideration for users outside of China is the cultural difference towards data and the internet between China and the west. China is not a democracy and privacy is not granted the same protections that westerns may assume are present. I think it will take several years before we see Alibaba's impact in the US.
