/u/phatandblack on Burlington Mayor Bernie Sanders picks up trash on his own in a public park after being elected in 1981, his first electoral victory
I think he probably was, I don't know much about him before the whole campaign. But it is weird that he buys two houses after dropping out of a campaign he had in the bag. All while being the lowest paid senator and a hero of the regular man. If he wasn't bullshitting the entire time, he sure is now.
