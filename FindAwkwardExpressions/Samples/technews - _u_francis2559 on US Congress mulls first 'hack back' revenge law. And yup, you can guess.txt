/u/francis2559 on US Congress mulls first 'hack back' revenge law. And yup, you can guess what it'll let people do
If they're going to make physical analogies, let's say someone stole some files from my desk I value. I can't just go rummaging through the homes of my enemies until I find my documents. There's a good reason such behavior is entrusted to trained, limited, neutral third parties: the police. Frankly, this should be treated the same way. Ford shouldn't be able to hack GM if they get hacked.
