/u/tau-lepton on Xi Jinping to China: “Any harm we inflict on nature will eventually return to haunt us”
In reposnse to my comment about coal use going down you said Despite the cuts to coal production and falling percentage of coal in the energy mix, electricity consumption is expected to grow by 3.6-4 percent over 2016 to 2020 according to the Thirteenth Plan (2016–2020).[4] According to the same five-year plan, coal power capacity will be expanded from 960 GW to under 1,100 GW by the end of 2020 to meet some of the continued growth in electricity demand.[4] Indeed, in the first two months of 2016, China had added 22 GW of capacity, 14 GW of which was coal, according to the China Electricity Council"  Which says zero about coal use, if they use more efficient plants then coal use can go down while capacity goes up.
