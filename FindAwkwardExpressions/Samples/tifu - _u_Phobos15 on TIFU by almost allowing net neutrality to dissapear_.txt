/u/Phobos15 on TIFU by almost allowing net neutrality to dissapear.
This is all trump. He replaced a consumer friendly FCC chair with an empty suit that wants to roll the clock back to the 1920s. He is also trying to undo Obama's updated broadband definition. Rural ISPs used to be able to steal US government rural broadband funds to install shitty 1.5mbit dsl. Wheeler updated the standard to 25mbps while still absurdly low, prevents any kind of adsl from milking government funds. Now ISPs need to install coax or fiber all the way to the home. They are trying to drop the standard down to 10mbps because then 12mbps adsl will qualify, even if distance causes the end user to only get 1.5mbps or less. When they make their FCC changes(technically nothing can stop them), it will fuck over so many. Net neutrality will be gone and ISPs will go back to refusing to install fiber in exchange for government broadband subsidies.
