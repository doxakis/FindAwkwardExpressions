/u/lmcinnes on Would it be possible to apply t-SNE to my data?
Using commenters provides a clean well defined way to compare overlaps; including authors is certainly possible but it would complicate the query, and I'm not convinced that it adds a lot. I would pick one or the other (commenters or authors) and stick with that. I would be loathe to pick random commenters since the resulting overlap matrix will likely be very sparse (the odds of two random commenters sharing a subreddit is low). Following the FiveThirtyEight analysis I went with the top subreddits, to ensure reasonable density of overlaps. Similarly I would suggest you probably want to look at the most prolific commenters to help ensure better odds of overlaps. Finally the BigQuery code is here; hopefully that link works. I can't take much credit for it, it's stright from FiveThirtyEight with only minor tweaks, but it should be clear how one would go about modifying it for your needs. The first query is a matter of finding the top subreddits (you want to find the top commenters); the second is computing the overlaps selecting subreddits from the top subreddits table.
