/u/MNGrrl on TIFU by almost allowing net neutrality to dissapear.
If you have a worthwhile point I'd love to hear it, but don't go around spreading FUD on half-truths.  Ok, I'll bite. Facts ensue. At the end of 2015, the fixed broadband penetration rate in Portugal exceeded 30 accesses per 100 inhabitants (30.3%)  Cable networks now account for 33.8% of total accesses, [...] ADSL represents 33.1% of total accesses.   Drill down and you'll see the trend: More people are using mobile networks, using them more, and make up the majority of internet access in the country. In the US, I believe it was this year that marked the point when mobile internet accesses exceeded desktop. Relevancy intensifies. You're showing off "actual home internet and phone plans", but that's not what most people are using to get online. What about speed?? Good question. Our mobile broadband ranking fell this past years, while theirs rose 15 points. We're #45. They're #48. Project out a year, and we've got shittier networks than they do. While the OP posted a glib imgur post and probably isn't in my industry, I am, and I can vouch for the accuracy of the post. I would have used a different graphic though that shows all the major players side by side, and what they think differentiates them on service. You don't need to read the language to figure out the logos. Don't worry though, Here's a live link showing the right now this very moment same thing. On a real signup page. From the biggest ISP in the country. He's right. That is our future. NN died in Portgual at the same time the Obama administration instituted ours. Infrastructure investment plummeted, costs rose, and the dying words of consumers over there was ":cough: EU... :cough: save us... :cough:" Then they slipped under the waves.
