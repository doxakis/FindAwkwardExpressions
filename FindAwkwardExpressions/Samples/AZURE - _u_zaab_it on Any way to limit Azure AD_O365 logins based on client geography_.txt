/u/zaab_it on Any way to limit Azure AD/O365 logins based on client geography?
Blocking risky sign in is only with Azure AD P2... But you don't block countries or IP ranges... Basically if your user is usually in one country and suddenly he is detected in another country far away, sign-in will be blocked. I think you better look into MFA. AFAIK no country based restriction in Azure AD, and if you think about it, it's kinda useless...
