Not that familiar with TD sorry. Very few deep learning models use local rules and none that I know of that are used for RL, RL is just too hard and BP just so good. The only widely used local rule learning algorithm in DL (that I can think of) would be contrastive divergence in Restricted Boltzmann Machines.
