/u/Kardlonoc on Let's talk about what it means to be Not the Onion
Here are two articles from the onion about celeberties breaking limbs: http://sports.theonion.com/rob-gronkowski-breaks-bone-in-spiking-arm-1819590963 http://entertainment.theonion.com/gymnast-shawn-johnson-put-to-sleep-after-breaking-leg-1819594827 Yeah I am going to unsub over this. Primarily after you said to us "lol nobody will unsub fuk u" basically. Stop with the fucking hubris. I will be back after you mods stop arbitrarily deciding what is a Onion article and let the people decide. Right now you aren't following the good natured, silly and witty nature that is the Onion. You might think Ed Sheeren breaking both his arms is mundane but it isn't anyone breaking both arms sounds silly and is ripe for comedy. And this place doesn't need to be spot on because it never is. Its impossible but that's what upvotes are for to decide if it fits the sub. When people complain do something. That's when mods should intervene. Don't fix problems that don't exist. A lot of people are telling you, you are wrong and you aren't listening to them in the least. That's a sign you have lost touch with your members.
