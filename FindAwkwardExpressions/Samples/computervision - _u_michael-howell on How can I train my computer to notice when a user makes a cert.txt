/u/michael-howell on How can I train my computer to notice when a user makes a certain expression with their face?
Give the cognitive services a try. You could conceivably use a baseline (relaxed) then see if the expression change is detected. You might be surprised by the results... As an experiment, you can see if the theory works very quickly. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/face/ You could always ask Microsoft. A checky request might get you a long way. https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/ For the DIY option The theory goes that a pre-trained network learns faster. Then you only have to do a bit of extra training. The computer needs to be able to detect features like Eyes and mouths first. If you get it correct it will be amazingly accurate and precise. This is how the android face recognition works for example. If you go down this root. You can find tons of trained networks and data sets. The first thing about Machine Learning is Data, Data, and more data. http://www.face-rec.org/databases/
