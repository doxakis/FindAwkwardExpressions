/u/Urbanscuba on TIL that not only is USA the 3rd most populated country in the world, but if it had ONE BILLION MORE people, it would still be the 3rd most populated country in the world.
Being raised in an era where kids are expensive and valuable and have ample job opportunity is also rapidly westernizing the children. The rich send their kids to study in America, the EU, or Australia. The middle class has kids with ample internet access and very positive views of western culture. Many of them learn English and interact with the English section of the internet (one of the largest and most liberal/free). The kids growing up now in China have a great threat of being their boomers. Born during periods of incredible growth that they didn't earn, with job opportunities in excess and a strong looking future. The kids of today will be middle aged at the estimated time China will have fully modernized and become a superpower. The economy as a whole is going to slow down because of this, but it's making the current generation of young Chinese much more successful than their parents. A lot of these new middle class have parents that were farmers or vendors with no higher education whereas the Children have 4 year degrees from foreign universities. Really interesting to see where it'll go. It won't be long before China becomes the world's best consumer. Even if the average buyer in China has 1/3 the wealth as an American buyer, they have more than 3x as many consumers. China may well be "cool" one day and we'll end up with a mishmash like in Cyberpunk fiction. Every year I feel like we creep closer to a dystopian cyberpunk reality.
