/u/autotldr on Pixel 2 contains a custom Google SoC for image processing
This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 76%. (I'm a bot) The company has been talking a big game about the 2's camera and calling it, definitively, "The best smartphone camera." But Google has been keeping a huge secret under wraps: the Pixel 2 has a custom, Google-designed SoC dedicated exclusively to camera image processing. In addition to the usual Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, the Pixel 2 is equipped with the "Pixel Visual Core," an extra, second SoC designed by Google with hardware-accelerated image processing in mind. Using these IPU cores, Google says the company's HDR+ image processing can run "5x faster and at less than 1/10th the energy" than it currently does on the main CPU. The Pixel Visual Core is currently in the Pixel 2, but it doesn't work yet.  Extended Summary | FAQ | Feedback | Top keywords: Google#1 Pixel#2 SoC#3 design#4 Core#5
