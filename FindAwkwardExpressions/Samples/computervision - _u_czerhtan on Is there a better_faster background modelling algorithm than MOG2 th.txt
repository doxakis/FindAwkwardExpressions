/u/czerhtan on Is there a better/faster background modelling algorithm than MOG2 that run in real-time/high speed
It might be worthwhile to run a deblocking filter on the video first, and then tune the segmentation method so it is more sensitive to the specific kind of change you're looking for (texture/color). The motion blur might also be caught in the deblocking, but enough of the object should remain to still see it. Lots of modern background subtraction methods rely partly on local texture for foreground detection --- that might help you a bit. Keeping track of the object's position and movement using a generic object tracker could also help you pinpoint it, and reduce the burden on your classifier. Check out methods based on correlation filters (e.g. KCF), those are very lightweight, meaning you could run several in parallel without a big performance hit.
