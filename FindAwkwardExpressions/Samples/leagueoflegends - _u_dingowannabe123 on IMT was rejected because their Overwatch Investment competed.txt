/u/dingowannabe123 on IMT was rejected because their Overwatch Investment competed with League. Plain and Simple.
who the fuck called it stable? You're the one calling it stable. I'm the one calling strong. What I'm saying is that they have a structure that promotes a healthy environment to improve in. They literally completely starting from scratch this year you might as well call it a new team. Of course, as a result, you shouldn't expect much from them the first split. But due to the strong infrastructure, they made the right moves and ended up #2 in the Summer Split. You need to learn that playing with words doesn't win you arguments. Providing an actual counter argument does.
