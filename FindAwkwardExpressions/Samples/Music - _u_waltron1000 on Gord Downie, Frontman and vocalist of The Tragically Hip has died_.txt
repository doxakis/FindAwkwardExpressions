/u/waltron1000 on Gord Downie, Frontman and vocalist of The Tragically Hip has died.
I am 27 and have listened to the hip for 20+ years. I literally listen to them every week. My iPod has 150 of their songs and I don't skip ANY (except for Coconut Cream). This is a serious blow and it will take a long time to get over. RIP to a LEGEND.
