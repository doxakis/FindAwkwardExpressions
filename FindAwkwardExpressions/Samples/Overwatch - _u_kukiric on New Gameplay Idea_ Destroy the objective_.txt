/u/kukiric on New Gameplay Idea: Destroy the objective.
Ever played instagib/one shot modes in other games? The fun is in the tension of shootouts with limited ammo, and in the impact of each decision you make (flaking, rearming, risky shots, etc). Character variety can't really add much to that, so it's not a huge issue.
