/u/FauxGw2 on Scientists may have found a physiological, and seemingly treatable, cause for dyslexia hidden in tiny light-receptor cells in the human eye. In people with dyslexia, the cells were arranged in matching patterns in both eyes, which may be to blame for confusing the brain by producing “mirror” images.
Not at all for me. There are different times of it as well. I will remember things completely backwards as well as the reading problems. When I was tested and read up a large deal on it, even fixing this problem wouldn't help all dyslexic people.
