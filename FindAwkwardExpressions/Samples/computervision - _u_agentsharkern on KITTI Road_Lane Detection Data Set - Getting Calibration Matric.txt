/u/agentsharkern on KITTI Road/Lane Detection Data Set - Getting Calibration Matrices (Python/OpenCV or MATLAB)
Thank you for your reply. I have tried this kit but unfortunately I cannot get it to actually run (lots of different errors never related to the input/file directories). I have tried in many different environments (Python 2.7, 3.5, etc). Do you perhaps know the best environment to run this under for it to actually work? I've done my best to try to re-code it myself but it starts to get a bit out of my skill level. edit: I have also tried pykitti, which I can get to run, but am not sure where to go from there in order to perform the same process a the kit.
